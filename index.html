  <h1>Meiqi Zhao</h1>

  <p>
    I’m Meiqi Zhao, a second year graduate student at Illinois Institute of
    Technology,  major in Technical Communication and Information Architecture.
    I’m also the Teaching Assistant of Dr. Hazard,  who teaches Art of World
    Architecture History.
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from Eastern New Mexico University  with my B.S. degree in
    Broadcast Production, Mass Communication  with minor in Criminal Justice
    (watched too much CSI...)  And I had another B.A. degree in Film, Theatre
    and Literature.  The major I’m learning right now as a graduate student is
    completely different from what I have learned during undergraduate period,
    lots of research thing as well as coding and web designing -  they are
    challenging, of course, but they are interesting to learn as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose this major and decided to take this course is that they are useful.
    By defining “useful” I mean it would be easier to find a job with skills on
    coding. As I mentioned earlier, I want to be a journalism, especially war
    correspondent. However, with the world development, all the techniques and
    social needs are shouting out a big message: We need a more efficient way to
    live a life. With fast-paced daily routines of urban life, news are become
    less important, people are using their phones or laptops to fetch news
    instead of sit down watching TV or read newspaper. I want to adjust into
    this kind of life, and by using the techniques, I want to learn ways to
    build website, thus for a more convenient life for the society.
  </p>

<p>
  Although I’m struggling with this whole coding thing right now, I think once I
  get used to it and know more and more about the coding, I would be fluent in
  the sooner future.
  </p>

  <p>
    I still want to be a journalist after graduation. But if it doesn’t come
    true, at least I know how to build websites. I actually want to build a
    website for my own - for all the people that I have interviewed with, write
    down their stories and share the stories with the public - by reading other
    people’s life, I think it would be an interesting thing to do.

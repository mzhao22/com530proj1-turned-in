  <h1>Meiqi Zhao</h1>
  <p>I'm Meiqi Zhao, a graduate student studies Technical Communication and Information Architecture </p>
  <p>I'm very new to this coding thing, I was in Broadcast field for my undergrats, so I'm still adjusting this area.
    My career goal, actually I really want to be a journalist, especially a war correspondent. I know it sounds very
    unrealistic but let's keep dreaming, lol.</p>
    <p> I'm late to this project draft because there are so many things I need to catch up.
      Especially thank @Qi Zhang who helped me a lot with my tons of idiot questions! </p>
